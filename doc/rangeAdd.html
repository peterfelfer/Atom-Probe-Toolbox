<h1>rangeAdd</h1>
<pre>
  adds a range to a mass spectrum using graphical input
  output is the handle to the area plot and the corresponding text
 
  if multiple isotopic combinations of the same element are within the range,
  automatically the one with the higher abundance (peak height) will be taken
 
  if various ions of different element species are within one range,
  the user can choose the desired ion out of a list in a pop-up window;
  default selection is set to the ion with higher natural abundance
 
  if the new range covers an existing range, the command gets aborted
 
  if the new range is entirely covered by an existing range, the command
  gets aborted
 
  if the new range partially overlaps with an existing range, the new range
  gets clipped to the adjacent range
 
  if no inserted ion is located within the range, the user can manually enter a
  range name (must be an ion, which is included in colorScheme) in a pop-up window
 
  possible use without specific outputs: rangeAdd(spec,colorScheme)
  generates only area (ans) but no handle or text in the workspace
 
  [h, txt] = rangeAdd(spec,colorScheme)
  [h, txt] = rangeAdd(spec,colorScheme,manualName)
 
 
  INPUT
  spec:         area plot that displays the mass spectrum (histogram of
                m/c frequencies)either in raw counts or normalised to bin
                width and total ion count
 
  colorScheme:  table with elements assigned to color code
 
  manualName:   name of range if no ion is defined, following keywords
                are possible: 'background'. This defines a background range
                If it is a valid ion name including charge state and 
                isotope information, e.g. 16O 1H2 +, the range table is
                filled out analogous to a regular range
 
  rangeLimits: limits of the range without graphical input. Used for
               building up a range figure e.g. from an HDF5
 
  OUTPUT
  h:            handle to the area plot of the range
  txt:          corresponding text
