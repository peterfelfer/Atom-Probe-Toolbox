<h1>roiCreatePlane</h1>
<pre>
  roiCreatePlane creates a plane in the current or parsed axis with 
  specified width and height at location. 
  spacing gives the approximate spacing between vertices for later analysis
  purposes. leave at 0 for simple plane object with no subdivision.
  Output is handle to the object for later manipulation.
 
  ph = roiCreatePlane(dimensions,spacing)
  ph = roiCreatePlane(dimensions,spacing,location)
  ph = roiCreatePlane(dimensions,spacing,location,ax)
 
  INPUT
  dimensions:   1x2 array with x and y dimensions of the plane
 
  spacing:      1x2 array with the spacing value in x and y direction
 
  location:     coordinates of the ROI's center given as [x y] 
                default is [0 0]
 
  ax:           axes in which the ROI is orientated
 
  OUTPUT
  ph:           handle to the ROIplane
