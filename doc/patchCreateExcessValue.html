<h1>patchCreateExcessValue</h1>
<pre>
  patchCreateExcessValue calculates the average interfacial excess for an 
  interface with an interactive interface for the interfacial excess 
  determination 
  reads a pos file (with x, y, and z) and a vertex file 
  with x, y, and z) and assigns every atom to the closest vertex
 
  patchCreateExcessValue(pos,parentPos,interface)
  patchCreateExcessValue(pos,parentPos,interface,vertices)
 
  INPUT
  pos:          table, pos file of the atom species, of which an interfacial excess 
                should be calculated
 
  parentPos:    table, pos file of all atom species; optimally all unranged
                atoms are excluded
 
  interface:    structure with fields of faces (f) and vertices (v)
 
  vertices:     optional, if the interfacial excess of a specific region is
                wanted
