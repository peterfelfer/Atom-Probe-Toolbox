<h1>rangeAddAll</h1>
<pre>
  rangeAddAll is a convenient function that guides the user through the
  ranging process for all defined ionic peaks that currently have no range
  associated with them. The focus in the figure is automatically given to
  the current peak and the region around it. 
  When the peak is in focus, the user needs to range it manually. If the 
  peak should be skipped, enter must be pressed.
 
  rangeAddAll(spec,colorScheme,rangeMargin)
 
  INPUT
  spec:         figure, that holds the mass spectrum with the peaks which 
                will be ranged
 
  colorScheme:  color scheme with colors for the ranges
 
  rangeMargin:  is the number of Da before and after the peak that are
                displayed
  useMin:       the user can choose between 'true' and 'false'
                false:  the user will be taken through every peak
                true: the user can draw a line over the mass spectrum and
                only the peaks higher than the line are taken into account
                for the ranging
