<h1>peakBGCorrectedCount</h1>
<pre>
  peakBGCorrectedCount fits a linear background (least squares) to a peak in a mass spectrum
  based on 'brushed' background bins. For this, the mass spectrum has to be
  in the active axes, with the background bins marked. Also plots the
  results.
  
  [peakData] = peakBGCorrectedCount(pos, rangeTable, ionName, boundary)
  
  [peakData] = peakBGCorrectedCount( pos, rangeTable, ionName)
  [peakData] = peakBGCorrectedCount( pos, rangeTable, ionName, boundary)
  [peakData] = peakBGCorrectedCount( pos, rangeTable, ionName, boundary, options)
 
  INPUT
  massSpec   a massSpec plot - created with massSpecPlot.m
  pos        pos file - in raw format
  ionName    ion Name in this form '14N 12C2 +' it is important to write the
             specific isotopes
  rangeTable if no range Table is parsed - the gcf has to be the massSpec
                of the pos variable
  boundary   range in Da before and after the peak that should be used for
             background correction either one value or two [3 3] are
             allowed. If no value is parsed, the default value of 0.5 Da is used 
  figure     true - figure window is created (default)
             false - figure window is suppressed
  offset     if you want to have an offset between the range from the
             rangeTable and the background correction range just possible
             with boundaries
  options    'r': add a fictional range and calculate the signal to background for that
             range
             'a': same as 'r', but automatically created ranges by optimising the
             ratio of missed atoms / background atoms = 1
 
  OUTPUT
  peakData   struct array with the counts of the ions in the peak, the
             percentage and the location of the peak
  figure     figure with the peak and the correction
