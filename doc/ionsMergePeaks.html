<h1>ionsMergePeaks</h1>
<pre>
  ionsMergePeaks takes a list of isotopic combinations and merges peaks 
  that are closer than mergeMargin
  
  [ionType, abundance, weight] = ionsMergePeaks(ionType, abundance, weight, mergeMargin)
  
  INPUT
  ionType:                      type of the ion for that peaks should 
                                be merged
  
  abundance:                    relativ abundance of the peak in 
                                the mass spectrum
 
  weight:                       weight of the ion
 
  mergeMargin:                  peaks within this range will be merged
  
  OUTPUT
  [ionType, abundance, weight]: cell array of merged peaks
                                sorted by molecular weight
