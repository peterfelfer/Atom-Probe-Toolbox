<h1>scatterPlotPosData</h1>
<pre>
  scatterPlotPosData plots APT data in the typical APT style.
  
  [p, ax] = scatterPlotPosData(pos,species,sample,colorScheme,size,plotAxis)
  [p, ax] = scatterPlotPosData(pos,species,sample,colorScheme,size)
  [p, ax] = scatterPlotPosData(pos,species,sample,colorScheme)
  
  INPUT
  pos:            decomposed or allocated pos file with pos.ion column      
  
  species:        Which ion/atom species should be plotted
                  one single ion {'C'}
                  more ions {'H','C','N'}
                  if multiple species are given and no plotAxis, array of 
                  axes is plotted with synched axis movement. 
                  Otherwise they all go into the same axis.
  
  sample:         allows the specification of a subset to plot. 
                  If sample &lt;1, it is a fraction of the overall number of
                  atoms, if &gt;1, it is a fixed number. Can be a scalar or a 
                  vector with same length as species.
  
  colorScheme:    a colorScheme can be parsed or a RGB color vector
 
  size:           size of the single atoms in the plot
                  can be a scalar or a vector with same length as species.
 
  plotAxis:       an axis for the plot can be parsed. If no plotAxis is 
                  parsed, a new axis is created. If you want to plot
                  mulitple Ions in one plot write axes(figure()) for
                  plotAxis.
  
  OUTPUT
  p:              plot handle
 
  ax:             axis from the plot, important for tiled plot
