  posInConvexHull: tests if a set of points is inside a convex hull
 
  in = posInConvexHull(pos,xyz)
  in = posInConvexHull(pos,xyz,tess)
  in = posInConvexHull(pos,xyz,tess,tol)
 
  INPUT
  pos:      n*p array to test, n data points, in p dimensions
            If you have many points to test, it is most efficient to
            call this function once with the entire set.
 
  xyz:      m*p array of vertices of the convex hull, as used by
            convhulln.
 
  tess:     tessellation (or triangulation) generated by convhulln
            If tess is left empty or not supplied, then it will be
            generated.
 
  tol:      (OPTIONAL) tolerance on the tests for inclusion in the
            convex hull. You can think of tol as the distance a point
            may possibly lie outside the hull, and still be perceived
            as on the surface of the hull. Because of numerical slop
            nothing can ever be done exactly here. I might guess a
            semi-intelligent value of tol to be
 
            tol = 1.e-13*mean(abs(xyz(:)))
 
            In higher dimensions, the numerical issues of floating
            point arithmetic will probably suggest a larger value
            of tol.
 
            DEFAULT: tol = 0
 
  OUTPUT
  in:       nx1 logical vector
            in(i) == 1 --&gt; the i'th point was inside the convex hull.
   
  Example usage: The first point should be inside, the second out
 
   xy = randn(20,2);
   tess = convhulln(xy);
   testpoints = [ 0 0; 10 10];
   in = inhull(testpoints,xy,tess)
 
  in = 
       1
       0
 
  A non-zero count of the number of degenerate simplexes in the hull
  will generate a warning (in 4 or more dimensions.) This warning
  may be disabled off with the command:
 
    warning('off','inhull:degeneracy')
