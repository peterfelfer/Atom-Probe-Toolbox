<h1>posCalculateConcentrationSimple</h1>
<pre>
  posCalculateConcentrationSimple calculates the concentration of a
  categorical list of atoms or ions
 
  conc = posCalculateConcentrationSimple(pos, detEff, excludeList,volumeName);
  conc = posCalculateConcentrationSimple(pos, detEff, excludeList)
  conc = posCalculateConcentrationSimple(pos, detEff)
 
  INPUT
  pos:          decomposed pos file that contains ion and charge state of
                the individual atoms
 
  detEff:       detector efficiency of the atom probe, can be parsed as 
                or as a fraction (for a LEAP 4000X HR it is 0.37)
                
  excludeList:  cell array that contains as character the individual
                ions that shall not be considered for the concentration 
                calculation, unranged atoms appear as 'unranged', if not 
                parsed, no atoms will be excluded
 
  volumeName:   name of the volume, parsed as character array, if not parsed,
                the volume will be named after pos
 
  OUTPUT
  conc:         is a table that contains the count, concentration, and 
                variance for each atom/ion that is not on the excludeList.
                statistical deviation calculated after Danoix et al.,

                variance(conc) = conc*(1-conc)/numAtomsDetected * (1 - detEff)
