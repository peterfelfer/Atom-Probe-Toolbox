<h1>clusterDetermination</h1>
<pre>
 clusterDetermination calculates with the Voronoi tesselation and the
 Delaunay triangulation the cluster of the given dataset
 
  [pass, Nmin, clusterCutoff, clusteredAtoms] =
  clusterDetermination(clusterPos,pos,Nmin);
  [pass, Nmin, clusterCutoff, clusteredAtoms] =
  clusterDetermination(clusterPos,pos);
 
  INPUT
  
  clusterPos:   pos file that contains the atoms that are in the clusters
  pos:          pos file of the entire dataset
  Nmin:         at this value, the cluster has a higher probability that it
                it is clustered non-randomly than it's probability to be a random cluster
 
  OUTPUT
  clusterParameter: table that contains the genereal cluster Parameter
                    the KolSmirTest (1 = passed that means that the voronoi volume distribution deviates from
                    random , 0 = failed),
                    the clusterPercentage, 
                    Nmin (at this value, the cluster has a higher probability that it
                    it is clustered non-randomly than it's probability to be a
                    random cluster) and the 
                    clusterCutOff Volume (max volume of the voronoi cell of the clustered atoms)
  clusteredAtoms:   pos file of the clustered atoms
  clusterPosVol:    clusterPos with an additional row that contain the
                    calculated VornoiVolumes of each cell
  randomVolumes     the randomly calculated Dataset and the corresponding
                    random Volume
