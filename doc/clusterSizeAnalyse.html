<h1>clusterSizeAnalyse</h1>
<pre>
  clusterSizeAnalyse plotts the cluster sizes as a histogram
  the y axis is the 'concentration' the occurences. This is the invertse of
  the 1d voronoi tessellation of the occurences, or N for N occurences
  of the same value.
 
 
 
  INPUT
  expClusterSizes: experimental cluster sizes
  ranClustersizes: random cluster sizes
 
  OUTPUT
  Nmin: at this value, the cluster has a higher probability that it
        it is clustered non-randomly than it's probability to be a
        random cluster
