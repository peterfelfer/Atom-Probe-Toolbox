<h1>ionsCreateComplex</h1>
<pre>
  ionsCreateComplex creates a list of all complex ions that can be formed
  by the given elements, based on the isotopeTable. 
 
  ionList = ionsCreateComplex(elements,complexity,isotopeTable);
  ionList = ionsCreateComplex(elements,complexity,isotopeTable,chargeStates);
  
  INPUT
  elements:     list of elements that form the complexes, either as cell,
                string {'Fe','Cr','O',...} or as vector of atomic numbers
                HINT: the cell can be extracted from the decomposed
                pos file as elements = categories(pos.atom)
                HINT: to use many elements, standard matlab linear vector
                generation can be used, e.g. elements = 1:100 
 
  complexity:   vector of ion complexities to be included, e.g. [1 2 3]
 
  isotopeTable: isotopeTable used for the analysis
 
  chargeStates: vector of charge states to be included, e.g. [1 2 3], 
                chargeStates are optional, default is +1 - +3
 
  OUTPUT
  ionList:      table with fields:
                ion, ionIsotopic: categorical with ion names
                mc: mass-to-charge value of the individual isotopic
                combinations in amu
 
  WARNING: the number of permutations of ions grows with the Gamma
  function. Beware when creating very large complexities. For the entire
  periodic system, anything above a complexity of 2 will lead to a very
  long list.
