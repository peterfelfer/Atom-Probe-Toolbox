<h1>chargeStateRatioCalculate</h1>
<pre>
  chargeStateRatioTable = chargeStateRatioCalculate(element,pos,chargeStates)
  calculates the chargeStateratio of an element and his chargeStates in the
  pos
 
  chargeStateRatioTable = chargeStateRatioCalculate(element,pos,chargeStates)
 
  INPUT
  
  element:      character with the name of the element of interesst
 
  pos:          decomposed pos file that contains ion and charge state of
                the individual atoms
 
  chargeStates: double withe the chargeStates of interest
 
  OUTPUT
  chargeStateRatioTable:    
                table with total counts of chargeStates and the ratio to
                the chargeStates
