<h1>massSpecPlot</h1>
<pre>
  massSpecPlot plots the data from pos to get a mass spectrum as a figure
 
  handle = plotMassSpec(mc, bin, mode)
  handle = plotMassSpec(mc, bin)
 
  INPUT
  mc:       is the mass-to-charge(mc)-ratio [Da] of the events in the
            APT measurement stored in pos, table
 
  bin:      is the width of the steps in which the plot is performed
 
  mode:     specifies the way the counts are applied
            'count' records the number of counts
            'normalised' records the number of counts if the bin was one Da
            wide over the overall number of counts
            default mode is 'count'
 
  OUTPUT
  handle:   handle to the plot that contains counts or
            (counts/Dalton)/totalCounts over Dalton. Used in further
            analysis to find new ions
