<h1>patchToPly</h1>
<pre>
  patchToPly saves a patch to a ply file (polygon file format). This format
  contains information about the coloring of individual vertices and can be
  read by many popular 3d programs. A file definition can be found on: <a href="http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/">http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/</a>
 
  patchToPly(fv);                
        opens a "Save *.ply file to" window
 
  patchToPly(fv, vertColors);    
        opens a "Save *.ply file to" window
 
  patchToPly(fv, vertColors, 'filename.ply'); 
        saves filename.ply in current folder
  
  patchToPly(fv, vertColors, 'filename.ply', 'comment');
        saves filename.ply in current folder, including a comment
 
  INPUTS:
    fv:          structure with faces (f) and vertices (v)
    
    vertColors:  represents color code for all vertices;
                 must be a n-by-3 array with n = number of vertices 
                 color code values must be all integers between 0 and 255
                 or all values &lt;1
