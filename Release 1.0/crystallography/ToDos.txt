functionality to implement:

basic:
definition of a crystal structure (*.cif import?)
definition of a crystal orientation
definition of a crystal object
  -structure
  -orientation
  -boundaries
display of crystal orientation (primitive cubes/hexagons etc.)
containment test for grains
calculation of directions and planes
IPF colouring for interfaces (can orientations be included?)
IPF property plotting (e.g. concentration or interfacial excess)
plane fitting for linear objects
lattice generation
local orientation / signal strength analysis (SDM/FFT?)

optional advanced:
Wulff plots for FDMs
Piecewise linear interpolation of orientations for orientation gradients
lattice rectification
